part 2 pseudocode:
choose static word, use lower()
game won = False
prompt user for guess while remaining guesses > 0
    guess.lower() is in word       
        guess == word
            game won = True
            break
        guess != word
            remaining guesses -1
            continue
    guess.lower() not in word
        remaining guesses -1
if game won == False
    lose game
if won game == True
    win game
